# Week 10 Lab Report 5

## How I found the tests with different results
I searched manually for different results. I compared the results.txt file I got from the week 9 markdown-parse implementation and the links I got from doing the `bash script.sd` command on my own implementation. The reason why I did not generate a results text file for my implementation was because a lot of the test cases resulted in an infinite loop. I did not know how to skip infinite loops while creating a results file, so I searched manually instead.

## Difference 1: test 489.md
- the test case:
![test-case-1](test-case-1.png)
- class implementation result:
![class-result-1](class-result-1.png)
- My implementation result:
![my-result-1](my-result-1.png)

## Difference 2: test 519.md
- the test case:
![test-case-2](test-case-2.png)
- class implementation result:
![class-result-2](class-result-2.png)
- My implementation result:
![my-result-2](my-result-2.png)
