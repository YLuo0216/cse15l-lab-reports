# Week 10 Lab Report 5

## How I found the tests with different results
I searched manually for different results. I compared the results.txt file I got from the week 9 markdown-parse implementation and the links I got from doing the `bash script.sd` command. 
The reason why I did not have a results text file for my implementation was because a lot of the test cases resulted in an infinite loop. I did not know how to skip infinite loops while 
creating a results file, so I searched manually instead.
